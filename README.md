Snake game


###2021-03-27

Spent some time trying to understand how Threads work, by making a different class,
created another class for testing a possible title screen feature

Need to create collision and change it so the snake can't make 180 degree turns

TitleScreenTest ended up being a big waste of time and mainly because I had no
clue why draw(); wasn't working when it was outside the loop but I today I realised
it's probably because of the buffer
